# 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) 

Welcome to my **DSA** repository!  
This is a structured collection of my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms — solving problems, understanding complexities, and preparing for coding interviews. The repo includes categorized practice problems, explanations, and optimized code implementations.
